<h3 style ="margin-top: 20px;"> Data Description</h3>
<div style ="margin-bottom: 10px;">
<p>The Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset is a collection of real-world images that contain house numbers from various scenarios, including street addresses, storefronts, and building exteriors. The dataset is derived from Google Street View images and has been widely used for tasks related to digit recognition and multi-digit number classification.</p>
<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Image Format:</strong> The dataset consists of RGB images in a variety of sizes and aspect ratios. Each image represents a real-world scene containing one or more house numbers.</li>
  <li><strong>Labeling:</strong> The dataset provides accurate bounding box information and label annotations for the digits present in each image. This information allows for precise digit localization and classification.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-digit Numbers:</strong> The SVHN dataset includes images with single-digit numbers as well as those with multiple digits. The dataset provides information about the location, order, and labeling of each digit within a multi-digit number.</li>
  <li><strong>Large-Scale Dataset:</strong> The SVHN dataset is relatively large, containing tens of thousands of labeled images for training, validation, and testing. It offers a diverse range of real-world scenarios, capturing variations in fonts, colors, backgrounds, and digit appearance.</li>
  <li><strong>Training, Validation, and Testing Sets:</strong> The dataset is typically divided into three separate sets: a training set used to train the model, a validation set used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection, and a testing set for evaluating the model's performance on unseen data.</li>
  <li><strong>Class Distribution:</strong> The SVHN dataset is typically labeled with the digits 0-9 as the classes. The dataset's class distribution ensures a balance of examples for each digit, providing equal representation across the different digits.</li>
</ul>
<p>The SVHN dataset serves as a valuable resource for developing and evaluating models for digit recognition, multi-digit classification, and address-related tasks. It offers a realistic and challenging dataset that reflects the complexity and variations encountered in real-world house number recognition scenarios.</p>

     <div style ="margin-bottom: 10px;">
  The classification results indicate the precision, recall, and F1-score for each class in the house number classification task. Here is a summary of the performance metrics:<br>

Precision: Precision is the measure of how many of the predicted positive instances are actually true positives. It represents the accuracy of positive predictions. Overall, the precision values for most classes range from 0.86 to 0.93, indicating a relatively high level of accuracy in correctly identifying the respective house number class.<br>

Recall: Recall, also known as sensitivity or true positive rate, measures the proportion of actual positive instances that are correctly identified. The recall values for most classes range from 0.86 to 0.94, indicating a good ability of the model to capture true positives.<br>

F1-score: The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure of the model's performance. The F1-scores for most classes range from 0.88 to 0.94, reflecting a reasonable balance between precision and recall.<br>

The accuracy of the model on the entire dataset is 0.91, indicating that the model achieves an overall accuracy of 91% in classifying house numbers.<br>
